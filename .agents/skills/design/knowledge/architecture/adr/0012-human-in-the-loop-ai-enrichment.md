# Human-in-the-Loop AI Enrichment

## Context
Automated background AI data enhancements (scraping directories or sites) can hallucinate or fetch out-of-date information, which corrupt authoritative data profiles if applied autonomously.

## Decision
establish Human-in-the-Loop gating policy: non-critical data (like logos) applied autonomously, but critical business fields (email, phone, address) must generate `PendingChange` or `ClientEnrichmentProposal` inside `ReviewQueue`. only committed to authoritative records upon manual user validation. High-confidence suggestions (>95%) can bypass manual review only if explicit auto-reconcile settings active.

## Consequences
- Protects core database integrity from AI hallucination or ingestion drift.
- Empowers user governance over automated updates.
- Adds database collections (`pending_changes`) and requires dedicated review UI.
