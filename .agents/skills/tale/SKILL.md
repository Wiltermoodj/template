# ASD-STE100 Issue 9 Simplified Technical English (STE)

This skill governs the written communication style for **AI agents, code comments, architecture records, pull request descriptions, and user-facing reports**.

All documentation and agent output must obey the writing rules and controlled vocabulary defined in **ASD-STE100 Issue 9 (January 15, 2025)** ([resources/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9.pdf](resources/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9.pdf)).

---

## 1. The Eight Non-Negotiable STE Rules

1. **One Word, One Meaning, One Part of Speech:** Use approved words only as their specified part of speech. Do not use technical nouns as verbs.
2. **Strict Semicolon Prohibition:** Semicolons (`;`) are **strictly prohibited**. Always split compound thoughts into separate sentences with periods (`.`).
3. **No Contractions or Omissions:** Never use contractions (*do not*, *cannot*, *is not*). Never omit articles (*a*, *an*, *the*) or demonstratives (*this*, *these*).
4. **Sentence Word Limits:** 
   - **Maximum 20 words** for procedural instructions (commands).
   - **Maximum 25 words** for descriptive sentences.
5. **Strict Active Voice & Simple Tenses:** Write in the active voice. Use only Infinitive, Imperative, Simple Present, Simple Past, and Simple Future (*will*).
6. **No Progressive "-ing" Verbs:** Never use "-ing" words as progressive action verbs (`is running`, `was opening`). Use "-ing" words only as technical nouns (`the bearing`) or modifiers (`cooling system`).
7. **Multi-Word Noun Limit:** Multi-word nouns must not exceed **three words** (for example, *APU shutoff valve*).
8. **Paragraph Limits:** Maximum of **one topic** and **six sentences** per paragraph.

## 2. Fast Reference Routing

When crafting text, consult these specialized sub-references:

| Topic | Reference Document | Key Focus Areas |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **All Writing Rules** | [references/rules_summary.md](references/rules_summary.md) | Full rules for Part 1 (Sections 1–9, GR-1 thru GR-8) |
| **Recurring Errors & Vocabulary** | [references/dictionary_recurring_errors.md](references/dictionary_recurring_errors.md) | 40+ non-STE words and approved replacements |
| **Approved Verbs Index** | [references/approved_verbs.md](references/approved_verbs.md) | Exhaustive list of all approved STE verbs |
| **Punctuation & Word Counting** | [references/word_count_and_punctuation.md](references/word_count_and_punctuation.md) | Punctuation limits, units counting as 1 word |
| **Transformation Recipes** | [references/transformation_guide.md](references/transformation_guide.md) | Before/after pairs for architecture docs, PRs, and notes |
| **Code & Identifier Standards** | [references/code_and_identifier_standards.md](references/code_and_identifier_standards.md) | Identifier names, <=3-word noun clusters, TSDoc comments |

---

## 3. High-Impact Quick Replacement Matrix

| Non-STE Word / Phrasing | Approved STE Equivalent | Example Revision |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `acceptable` *(adj)* | **PERMITTED** *(adj)* | "A delay of 5 ms is permitted." |
| `check` *(verb)* | **CHECK** *(noun)* / **EXAMINE** *(verb)* | "Do a check of the response payload." |
| `ensure` *(verb)* | **MAKE SURE** *(verb)* | "Make sure that the database connection is open." |
| `perform` / `execute` *(verb)* | **DO** *(verb)* | "Do the migration script." |
| `rotate` *(verb)* | **TURN** *(verb)* | "Turn the dial clockwise." |
| `should` / `shall` *(verb)* | **MUST** *(verb)* | "The client must send the authentication token." |
| `since` *(as because)* | **BECAUSE** *(conj)* | "Because the lock expired, the task aborted." |
| `therefore` *(adv)* | **THUS** *(adv)* / **AS A RESULT** | "Thus, the transaction rolls back." |
| `under` *(for values)* | **LESS THAN** / **BELOW** | "When latency is less than 50 ms..." |
| `using` / `utilize` *(verb)* | **USE** *(verb)* / **WITH** *(prep)* | "Use the CLI tool to inspect the state." |
| `e.g.`, `i.e.`, `etc.` | **for example**, **that is**, **and so on** | Replace all Latin abbreviations. |

## 4. Automated CLI Linter

Validate markdown files, directories, text strings, or code comments against ASD-STE100 Issue 9 rules with zero third-party dependencies:

```bash
# Validate all markdown documentation across current repository (default)
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs

# Automatically fix safe violations (contractions, Latin terms, ensure -> make sure that)
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs --fix
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs --fix docs/

# Validate markdown documentation files or directories
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs knowledge/architecture/CONTEXT-MAP.md
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs knowledge/architecture/

# Validate code comments and docstrings in TypeScript/JavaScript files
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs src/modules/shopify-sync/
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs --code src/

# Validate both documentation and code comments
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs --all src/ docs/

# Validate a text or comment snippet directly
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs --text "Make sure that the register records positive integer cents."
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs --text "// Make sure that the database connection is open."

# Output structured JSON report
node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs knowledge/architecture/ --json
```

## 5. Universal Installation

To install this skill into another repository or globally on your machine:

```bash
# Install to current repository (.agents/skills/tale)
bash .agents/skills/tale/scripts/install.sh

# Install to a specific target project
bash .agents/skills/tale/scripts/install.sh --project /path/to/project

# Install globally for all repositories (~/.gemini/config/skills/tale)
bash .agents/skills/tale/scripts/install.sh --global
```

## 6. Agent Execution Loop

When generating responses or authoring documentation in this repository:
1. **Analyze:** Check sentence word lengths (<=20 / <=25), scan for semicolons, scan for unapproved words or passive voice.
2. **Replace:** Convert unapproved terms using [references/dictionary_recurring_errors.md](references/dictionary_recurring_errors.md) and [references/approved_verbs.md](references/approved_verbs.md).
3. **Refactor:** Convert passive structures to active voice, put conditions first for instructions, and split compound sentences into single-topic sentences.
4. **Verify:** Run `node .agents/skills/tale/scripts/tale-lint.mjs <file>` on authored markdown files or code comments.

---

## 7. Agent Reasoning & Internal Monologue Standard

When generating internal thoughts or reasoning:
1. **Bullet Points Only:** Use 2 to 4 bullet points per thought block.
2. **Telemetric Cadence:** Report `State`, `Intent`, `Action`, and `Check`.
3. **Zero Conversational Fluff:** Prevent conversational preamble, rhetorical debates, or copying full files into thoughts.
4. **Sentence Limit:** Keep each bullet sentence less than 20 words.

---

## 8. Code Authoring & Identifier Naming Standard

When authoring code:
1. **Action-First Functions:** Start function names with an approved action verb (for example, `calculateTotal()`, `validateInput()`).
2. **Noun Cluster Cap:** Identifiers and variables must not exceed three words.
3. **Comments in Simple Present Tense:** Write comments in active voice stating *why* code exists. Prohibit semicolons and contractions in comments.
